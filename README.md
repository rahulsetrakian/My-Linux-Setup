# My-Kali-Setup
​An operator-grade, ultra-minimal Kali blueprint for VMware. Built for maximum speed and zero-distraction hacking, this setup prioritises reproducibility over "rice." It features a keyboard-driven Hyprland environment on vmwgfx, ensuring 100% stability for NVIDIA hosts while remaining entirely disposable via script.
